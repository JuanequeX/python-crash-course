In this chapter, you learned how to work efficiently with the elements in a
list. You learned how to work through a list using a for loop, how Python
uses indentation to structure a program, and how to avoid some common
indentation errors. You learned to make simple numerical lists, as well as a
few operations you can perform on numerical lists. You learned how to slice
a list to work with a subset of items and how to copy lists properly using a
slice. You also learned about tuples, which provide a degree of protection
to a set of values that shouldnâ€™t change, and how to style your increasingly
complex code to make it easy to read.
