# Beautiful is better than ugly.

# Python programmers embrace the notion that code can be beautiful
# and elegant. In programming, people solve problems. Programmers have
# always respected well-designed, efficient, and even beautiful solutions to
# problems. As you learn more about Python and use it to write more code,
# someone might look over your shoulder one day and say, “Wow, that’s some
# beautiful code!”

# Simple is better than complex.

# If you have a choice between a simple and a complex solution, and both
# work, use the simple solution. Your code will be easier to maintain, and it
# will be easier for you and others to build on that code later on.

# Complex is better than complicated.

# Real life is messy, and sometimes a simple solution to a problem is unat-
# tainable. In that case, use the simplest solution that works.

# Readability counts.

# Even when your code is complex, aim to make it readable. When you’re
# working on a project that involves complex coding, focus on writing infor-
# mative comments for that code.

# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

# If two Python programmers are asked to solve the same problem, they
# should come up with fairly compatible solutions. This is not to say there’s
# no room for creativity in programming. On the contrary, there is plenty of
# room for creativity! However, much of programming consists of using small,
# common approaches to simple situations within a larger, more creative
# project. The nuts and bolts of your programs should make sense to other
# Python programmers.

# Now is better than never.
# You could spend the rest of your life learning all the intricacies of
# Python and of programming in general, but then you’d never complete any
# projects. Don’t try to write perfect code; write code that works, and then
# decide whether to improve your code for that project or move on to some-
# thing new.
